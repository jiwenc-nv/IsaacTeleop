"""A MuJoCo scene drawn into a Televiz XR session.

One OpenXR session shared between XrTwinSession (rendering) and TeleopSession

The renderer needs an OpenGL context current on this thread; viz and the renderer
meet through CUDA alone, on the compositor's GPU. C++ owns
mjvScene/mjvOption/mjvCamera/mjrContext, Python owns mjModel/mjData.

Nothing is integrated -- mj_step is never called -- which makes one invariant
load-bearing: **one mj_forward after every `qpos`, `body_pos` or `mocap_*` write,
before every `xpos` / `xquat` / `geom_xpos` read, including the read inside
mjv_updateScene.** `mocap_*` is an INPUT to forward kinematics; the renderer draws
`geom_xpos`. See README.md for the rest of the design.
