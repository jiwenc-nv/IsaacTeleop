# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how to build, test, and submit changes.

## Code Style

- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and types in all languages.
- Write short docstrings for public modules, classes, and functions.
- Write clear, easy-to-read, and maintainable code.
- Keep code warnings and linter errors to a minimum.
- In general, prefer clarity over clever tricks, and keep the codebase friendly for contributors.

**C++**
- Use C++20.
- Format C++ with `clang-format`.

**Python**
- Follow PEP 8 for style.
- Use type annotations (PEP 484) and prefer formatted string literals (PEP 701, f-strings).

## Pre-commit

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run Python linters and formatters (including
[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)) before commits. If you are using uv like us, install the
tools and hooks as follows:

```bash
uv tool install ruff
uv tool install pre-commit
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
```

After that, pre-commit runs automatically on `git commit`. To run on all files manually:

```bash
SKIP=check-copyright-year pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run only Ruff (check + fix and format):

```bash
ruff check . --fix
ruff format .
```

### License headers

We use [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) to enforce SPDX license headers on source files. Pre-commit runs `reuse lint-file` on changed files (e.g. `.py`, `.cpp`, `.md`, `.yaml`):

1. **Required fields**: Each file must have `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` and `SPDX-License-Identifier`.
2. **License**: `SPDX-License-Identifier` must be `Apache-2.0` (full text in `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`).

Example header:

```
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright (c) 2025 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

To add or fix headers, install the [reuse tool](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool)

```bash
uv tool install reuse
```

and run for example:

```bash
reuse annotate -t compact -l Apache-2.0 --skip-unrecognised -r path/to/file
```

REUSE does not auto-update the copyright year when you touch a file; include the current year when adding or editing headers.

## CI
GitHub Actions builds the default targets and runs tests.

## Pull Requests
1. Create a feature branch
2. Ensure builds pass locally and in CI
3. Describe motivation, changes, and testing in the PR
4. Link related issues

## License
- Your contributions are under the repository’s license unless stated otherwise

### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
