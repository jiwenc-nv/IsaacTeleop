"""YAML-driven tmux launcher for Isaac Teleop rigs.

A *rig* is one teleop setup: the CloudXR runtime, one or more producer
plugins that publish device data, and one or more consumer apps (a Python
``TeleopSession`` script or a C++ binary) that read the streams. Rigs are
described by small YAML files (see ``rigs/se3_tracker.yaml`` in the Teleop
repository, and :mod:`~isaacteleop.rig.config` for the schema).

Usage::

    python -m isaacteleop.rig rigs/se3_tracker.yaml

The runtime pane starts immediately. Each producer/consumer pane waits
(up to two minutes) for the runtime to come up, sources the CloudXR env,
and then RUNS its command automatically. A command that exits early (the
classic: started before the headset connected) is left pre-typed at an
interactive prompt — one Enter reruns it. If the runtime never comes up
(or its env fails to load) the command is NOT run; the pane prints what
to do and leaves the command pre-typed.

The YAML schema is the stable contract; the Python API below is exported
for tests and power users on a best-effort basis.
