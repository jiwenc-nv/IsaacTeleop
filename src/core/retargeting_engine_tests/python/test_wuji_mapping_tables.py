"""Cross-check the two copies of the Wuji MediaPipe<->OpenXR joint mapping.

Both tables hold the same 21 entries — entry i is the OpenXR joint that
carries MediaPipe landmark i — but they drive opposite conversions: the C++
plugin scatters MediaPipe -> OpenXR (kMpToXr in wuji_glove_plugin.cpp) while
the Python retargeter gathers OpenXR -> MediaPipe (OPENXR_TO_MEDIAPIPE_INDICES
in wuji_hand_retargeter.py). They must stay identical entry for entry, or
joints get silently permuted at runtime.

Both tables are parsed from source so this test needs no wuji_sdk and runs
in the plain dev environment — unlike test_wuji_hand_retargeter.py, which
is gated on the wuji extra.
